# List-Management-Tool

## About

This tool is used to determine eligibility for accounts on a list for a specified utility `EDC` and mailing type `MailType` using data from the file(s) provided, external data, and manual input to determine the list of eligible accounts.
There are many special conditions and logic features built in for each EDC and MailType, which will be summarized in a later section (see [Special Cases](#special-cases)).
